## The problem / testing our method
### Stock market problem

The environment we are testing our algorithm on is trading on the stock market. The goal of our method is to train our model on one stock to maximize our returns. Then after our algorithm is trained on one stock, we want to see if it can generalize quickly on a stock that is similar to the one we trained on. For example, if we trained on the stock GOOGL and got good returns from our model, we should be able to run our model on a similar stock, say another stock in the same technology industry, like AMZN, and with little training the Meta-RL algorithm should get good results as well.
